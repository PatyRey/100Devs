<h2>Lab exercise </h2>

<p>Responsive websites</p>

<p>working through <a href = https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/performance-organization/> Shay Howe </a> online lessons. </p>

<p>This lab is a work and progress, I'm only using HTML and CSS to build the website at the moment. I will be adding JavaSript later on.</P>
