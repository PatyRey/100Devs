<span><strong>Responsive websites</strong></span>
<p>working through <a href = https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/performance-organization/> Shay Howe </a> online lessons. </p>
<p>This lab is a work and progress, I'm only using HTML and CSS to build the website at the moment. I will be adding JavaSript later on.</P>
