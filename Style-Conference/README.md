# Following along with Shay Howe
Lab exercise - Responsive websites - working through <a href = https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/performance-organization/> Shay Howe </a> online lessons. 
This lab is a work and progress, I'm only using HTML and CSS to build the website at the moment. I will be adding JavaSript later on
